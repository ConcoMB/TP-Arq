echo Now assembling, compiling, and linking your kernel:
nasm -f aout -o start.o start.asm
gcc -Wall -O -fstrength-reduce -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-functions -nostdinc -fno-builtin -I./include -c -o main.o main.c


rem This links all your files. Remember that as you add *.o files, you need to
rem add them after start.o. If you don't add them at all, they won't be in your kernel!
ld -T link.ld -o kernel.bin start.o
echo Done!
